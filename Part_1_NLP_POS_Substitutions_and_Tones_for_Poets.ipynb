made the misused clay when the body triumphed and the last poor shame departed these abode our agonies and wiped the sweat away who recalls the noontide and the funerals through the market blanket

cannot stop or think sweat is dry and feet are in the sand if there were only water amongst the rock dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit

the muttering retreats of restless nights in one night cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster shells streets that follow like tedious argument of insidious intent to lead you to an overwhelming question oh do not ask “what is it let us go and make our visit in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window panes licked its tongue into the corners of the evening lingered upon the pools that stand in drains let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys slipped by the terrace made sudden leap and seeing that it was soft october night curled once about the house and fell asleep and indeed there will be time for the yellow smoke that slides along the street rubbing its back upon the window panes there will be time there will be time to prepare face to meet the faces that you meet there will be time to murder and create and time for all the works and days of hands that lift and drop question on your plate time for you and time for me and time yet for hundred indecisions and for hundred visions and revisions before the taking of toast and tea in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo and indeed there will be time to wonder “do dare and “do dare time to turn back and descend the stair with bald spot in the middle of my hair— they will say “how his hair is growing thin my morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin my necktie rich and modest but asserted by simple pin— they will say “but how his arms and legs are thin do dare disturb the universe in minute there is time for decisions and revisions which minute will reverse for have known them all already known them all have known the evenings mornings afternoons have measured out my life with coffee spoons know the voices dying with dying fall beneath the music from farther room so how should presume and have known the eyes already known them all— the eyes that fix you in formulated phrase and when am formulated sprawling on pin when am pinned and wriggling on the wall then how should begin to spit out all the butt ends of my days and ways and how should presume and have known the arms already known them all— arms that are braceleted and white and bare but in the lamplight downed with light brown hair it is perfume from dress that makes me so digress arms that lie along table or wrap about shawl and should then presume and how should begin shall say have gone at dusk through narrow streets and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes of lonely men in shirt sleeves leaning out of windows should have been pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas and the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully smoothed by long fingers asleep tired or it malingers stretched on the floor here beside you and me should after tea and cakes and ices have the strength to force the moment to its crisis but though have wept and fasted wept and prayed though have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon platter am no prophet—and here is no great matter have seen the moment of my greatness flicker and have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snicker and in short was afraid and would it have been worth it after all after the cups the marmalade the tea among the porcelain among some talk of you and me would it have been worth while to have bitten off the matter with smile to have squeezed the universe into ball to roll it toward some overwhelming question to say “i am lazarus come from the dead come back to tell you all shall tell you all”— if one settling pillow by her head should say “that is not what meant at all that is not it at all and would it have been worth it after all would it have been worth while after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets after the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the floor— and this and so much more it is impossible to say just what mean but as if magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on screen would it have been worth while if one settling pillow or throwing off shawl and turning toward the window should say

the bottoms of my trousers rolled shall part my hair behind do dare to eat peach shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach have heard the mermaids singing each to each do not think

door of death other kingdom where as in this the eyes outlast little while little while outlast the tears and hold us in derision'}, {'Title': 'The Journey Of The Magi', 'Poem': 'cold coming we had of it just the worst time of the year for journey and such long journey the ways deep and the weather sharp the very dead of winter and the camels galled sorefooted refractory lying down in the melting snow there were times we regretted the summer palaces on slopes the terraces and the silken girls bringing sherbet then the camel men cursing and grumbling and running away and wanting their liquor and women and the night fires going out and the lack of shelters and the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly and the villages dirty and charging high prices hard time we had of it at the end we preferred to travel all night sleeping in snatches with the voices singing in our ears saying that this was all folly then at dawn we came down to temperate valley wet below the snow line smelling of vegetation with running stream and water mill beating the darkness and three trees on the low sky and an old white horse galloped away in the meadow then we came to tavern with vine leaves over the lintel six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver and feet kicking the empty wine skins but there was no information and so we continued and arriving at evening not moment too soon finding the place it was you might say satisfactory all this was long time ago remember and would do it again but set down this set down this were we led all that way for birth or death there was birth certainly we had evidence and no doubt had seen birth and death but had thought they were different this birth was hard and bitter agony for us like death our death we returned to our places these kingdoms but no longer at ease here in the old dispensation with an alien people clutching their gods should be glad of another death'}, {'Title': 'Portrait Of A Lady', 'Poem': 'thou hast committed— fornication but that was in another country and besides the wench is dead the jew of malta among the smoke and fog of december afternoon you have the scene arrange itself—as it will seem to do— with have saved this afternoon for you and four wax candles in the darkened room four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead an atmosphere of juliet tomb prepared for all the things to be said or left unsaid we have been let us say to hear the latest pole transmit the preludes through his hair and finger tips so intimate this chopin that think his soul should be resurrected only among friends some two or three who will not touch the bloom that is rubbed and questioned in the concert room —and so the conversation slips among velleities and carefully caught regrets through attenuated tones of violins mingled with remote cornets and begins you do not know how much they mean to me my friends and how how rare and strange it is to find in life composed so much so much of odds and ends for indeed do not love it… you knew you are not blind how keen you are to find friend who has these qualities who has and gives those qualities upon which friendship lives how much it means that say this to you— without these friendships—life what cauchemar among the windings of the violins and the ariettes of cracked cornets inside my brain dull tom tom begins absurdly hammering prelude of its own capricious monotone that is at least one definite false note —let us take the air in tobacco trance admire the monuments discuss the late events correct our watches by the public clocks then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks ii now that lilacs are in bloom she has bowl of lilacs in her room and twists one in her fingers while she talks ah my friend you do not know you do not know what life is you should hold it in your hands slowly twisting the lilac stalks you let it flow from you you let it flow and youth is cruel and has no remorse and smiles at situations which it cannot see smile of course and go on drinking tea yet with these april sunsets that somehow recall my buried life and paris in the spring feel immeasurably at peace and find the world to be wonderful and youthful after all the voice returns like the insistent out of tune of broken violin on an august afternoon am always sure that you understand my feelings always sure that you feel sure that across the gulf you reach your hand you are invulnerable you have no achilles heel you will go on and when you have prevailed you can say at this point many one has failed but what have but what have my friend to give you what can you receive from me only the friendship and the sympathy of one about to reach her journey end shall sit here serving tea to friends… take my hat how can make cowardly amends for what she has said to me you will see me any morning in the park reading the comics and the sporting page particularly remark an english countess goes upon the stage greek was murdered at polish dance another bank defaulter has confessed keep my countenance remain self possessed except when street piano mechanical and tired reiterates some worn out common song with the smell of hyacinths across the garden recalling things that other people have desired are these ideas right or wrong iii the october night comes down returning as before except for slight sensation of being ill at ease mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door and feel as if had mounted on my hands and knees and so you are going abroad and when do you return but that is useless question you hardly know when you are coming back you will find so much to learn my smile falls heavily among the bric brac perhaps you can write to me my self possession flares up for second this is as had reckoned have been wondering frequently of late but our beginnings never know our ends why we have not developed into friends feel like one who smiles and turning shall remark suddenly his expression in glass my self possession gutters we are really in the dark for everybody said so all our friends they all were sure our feelings would relate so closely myself can hardly understand we must leave it now to fate you will write at any rate perhaps it is not too late shall sit here serving tea to friends and must borrow every changing shape to find expression… dance dance like dancing bear cry like parrot chatter like an ape let us take the air in tobacco trance— well and what if she should die some afternoon afternoon grey and smoky evening yellow and rose should die and leave me sitting pen in hand with the smoke coming down above the housetops doubtful for quite while not knowing what to feel or if understand or whether wise or foolish tardy or too soon… would she not have the advantage after all this music is successful with dying fall now that we talk of dying— and should have the right to smile'}, {'Title': 'Morning At The Window', 'Poem': 'they are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens and along the trampled edges of the street am aware of the damp souls of housemaids sprouting despondently at area gates the brown waves of fog toss up to me twisted faces from the bottom of the street

        "Topic with 'man', 'formation', 'fightin', etc.:\n",
        "This cluster, featuring terms like \"man,\" \"formation,\" \"fightin,\" and \"sentry,\" likely points to themes of military life and discipline. The presence of \"bayonet\" and \"rubber\" could hint at physical aspects of military training or combat. Conclusion: This topic encapsulates the regimented and structured environment of military settings, possibly reflecting on the strictures and the personal struggles within such confines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'sister', 'face', 'body', etc.:\n",
        "Words such as \"sister,\" \"face,\" \"body,\" \"dust,\" and \"dirge\" suggest themes of family, mortality, and remembrance. \"Autumn,\" \"clay,\" and \"dust\" may metaphorically represent decay or the end of life cycles. Conclusion: This cluster reflects on familial ties and the inevitable passage of time, possibly exploring the emotional depth of personal loss and the natural process of aging or death.\n",

        "Topic with 'hump', 'camel', 'boot', etc.:\n",
        "This cluster includes a mix of words like \"hump,\" \"camel,\" and \"boot,\" combining elements of a fable or story (like \"How the Camel Got His Hump\") with more grounded, everyday items like \"boot.\" \"Garden,\" \"sun,\" and \"fire\" add a touch of either domesticity or myth. Conclusion: This topic might juxtapose the fantastical or narrative-driven elements with the mundane, exploring how stories intertwine with everyday realities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'man', 'ground', 'sea', etc.:\n",
        "Here, natural elements like \"ground,\" \"sea,\" \"earth,\" and \"clay\" are prominent, paired with \"man,\" \"heart,\" and \"love.\" This suggests themes of nature's expanse and human emotions tied to it. Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "This topic likely reflects on human connections to the earth and the sea, perhaps touching on themes of belonging, exploration, or environmental consciousness. It could be exploring how humans are inextricably linked to and affected by the natural world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'brigade', 'man', 'food', etc.:\n",
        "With a focus on words like \"brigade,\" \"man,\" \"food,\" and military terms like \"troop,\" \"charge,\" and \"sergeant,\" this cluster strongly emphasizes aspects of military organization and the camaraderie or challenges within. Conclusion: This topic likely delves into the collective and personal experiences of soldiers, emphasizing the logistical and emotional aspects of military life, possibly exploring themes of brotherhood, hierarchy, and survival.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'wood', 'road', 'skirt', etc.:\n",
        "This cluster, including \"wood,\" \"road,\" \"skirt,\" along with \"poem\" and \"meaning,\" suggests a setting of travel or a journey through nature, intertwined with poetic reflection or storytelling. Conclusion: This topic might represent a metaphorical or literal journey through life or nature, using the setting as a backdrop for deeper philosophical or existential musings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'boot', 'war', 'discharge', etc.:\n",
        "This cluster is clearly focused on the military with terms like \"boot,\" \"war,\" and \"discharge.\" The inclusion of \"poetry,\" \"music,\" and \"song\" within this military context suggests a blend of harsh realities with the artistic expressions that often comment on or arise from them. Conclusion: Reflecting on the duality of war's grim realities and the cathartic or reflective art it inspires, this topic may highlight how conflict influences culture and personal identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'sister', 'face', 'body', etc.:\n",
        "This cluster reiterates themes of personal identity and human conditions with a focus on body-related terms and familial connections, possibly pointing to narratives or poems dealing with personal relationships, identity, and the human condition reflected through physical and relational descriptions. Conclusion: Emphasizing interpersonal relationships and the intimate aspects of human experiences, this topic could explore the profound connections between individuals, perhaps within familial or close-knit community settings.\n",

        "Topic with 'macavity', 'cat', 'crime', etc.:\n",
        "This cluster clearly revolves around the character \"Macavity\" from T.S. Eliot's poem \"Macavity: The Mystery Cat\". The presence of terms like \"crime,\" \"mystery,\" \"law,\" and \"scene\" reinforces the portrayal of Macavity as a criminal mastermind elusive to law enforcement. Conclusion: This topic captures the essence of the playful yet intriguing depiction of a criminal cat, highlighting themes of cunning, elusiveness, and the whimsical subversion of typical criminal stories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'water', 'rock', 'time', etc.:\n",
        "Words like \"water,\" \"rock,\" \"mountain,\" and \"night\" suggest a natural setting, potentially evoking themes of the natural world's enduring and unyielding characteristics. Conclusion: This topic likely explores nature's vastness and timelessness, possibly reflecting on human experiences or emotions in contrast with nature's permanence and immensity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with minimal differences in terms like 'time', 'night', 'water', etc.:\n",
        "This set appears to emphasize the continual themes of time and nature but with a deeper focus on more abstract or introspective elements like \"death,\" \"woman,\" and \"evening.\" Conclusion: This topic delves into the cyclical nature of life, the inevitable passage of time, and the introspective moments that define human existence, often set against a backdrop of natural imagery.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'friend', 'afternoon', 'hand', etc.:\n",
        "Centering around social interactions and personal relationships, terms like \"friend,\" \"afternoon,\" \"tea,\" and \"smile\" suggest a setting of leisure and intimacy. Conclusion: This topic might represent scenes from social gatherings or personal reflections within friendships, offering a warm, inviting atmosphere conducive to sharing and personal reflection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'time', 'hair', 'night', etc.:\n",
        "With a heavy focus on \"time,\" \"night,\" and \"death,\" and integrating physical elements like \"hair\" and \"street,\" this cluster seems to weave together the personal and the existential. Conclusion: Reflecting on the passage of time and its impact on personal identity and mortality, this topic may explore how personal moments are framed within the broader context of life's transience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'water', 'friend', 'death', etc.:\n",
        "Incorporating both natural elements and human relationships, this cluster hints at narratives or themes where personal experiences intersect with natural settings, perhaps exploring life's transitional or transformative moments. Conclusion: This topic likely explores themes of journey and transformation, possibly metaphorically using elements like \"water\" and \"rock\" to symbolize life's challenges and changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with diverse terms ('macavity', 'time', 'cat', etc.):\n",
        "This cluster is broad, including \"Macavity,\" \"time,\" \"crime,\" and \"night,\" suggesting a blend of narrative storytelling with thematic exploration of time and moral ambiguities. Conclusion: This might reflect a comprehensive narrative style that blends character-focused storytelling with broader philosophical questions about morality and time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic with 'eye', 'tear', 'death', etc.:\n",
        "Focusing on highly emotive terms like \"eye,\" \"tear,\" and \"death,\" this cluster intensely explores themes of sorrow, loss, and reflection. Conclusion: Emphasizing the emotional responses to life's hardships, this topic delves into the depths of human grief, resilience, and the emotional spectrum associated with loss and remembrance."
